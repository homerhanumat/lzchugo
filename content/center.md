The Lexington Zen Center was founded in 1980 by Zen Master Dae Gak of <a href="http://www.furnacemountainzen.org/" target="_blamk">Furnace Mountain</a> in Powell County, Kentucky.  We are a small but welcoming community of practitioners.  Furnace Mountain was founded out of the Lexington Center, but nowadays we regard ourselves as affiliates of Furnace Mountain and  part of its worldwide Sangha.

Our primary regular activity is a weekly meditation service.  We also have a book group that meets roughly every other week, prior to meditation period.
  
Several times a year we hold a day-long retreat and we have open Sangha meetings as needed to discuss business and to reflect on the future direction of the Center.
