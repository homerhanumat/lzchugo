Muhan Shim (Daniela Herzog) is the Vice Abbess of Furnace Mountain and serves as Guiding Teacher for the Lexington Zen Center.

She began active Zen training 1993 in the European Kwan Um Zen School and was a co-founder of "Weißenbach Zen Center" in Germany soon thereafter.

In 2004 she received Inga (permission to teach) in the lineage of Zen Master Dae Gak.  In 2011 she moved to Furnace Mountain to commit her life to the dharma more fully.  In 2019 she received final Dharma Transmission from Zen Master Dae Gak.

Muhan Shim has a masters degree in education and works as a certified professional coach. She is trained in compassionate communication (NVC), voice dialogue, focusing, systemic constellation work and Naikan and includes those modalities in her work with Zen students.

She is especially interested in how death informs life, and invites inquiry into the great matter of birth and death as a co-host of regular &ldquo;Death Cafés&rdquo; in the Bluegrass and Red River Gorge area of Eastern Kentucky.

Tyson became a “book Buddhist” in 1997 when his only exposure to Buddhism was the small local bookstore in western Kentucky that had a half dozen books about Zen. He began a formal practice several years after moving to Lexington Kentucky. He has studied with several teachers over the years, but began studying under Zen Master Muhan Shim when she became Guiding Teacher of the Lexington Zen Center. Tyson became abbot of the Lexington Zen Center in 2017 and was named Senior Dharma Teacher in 2019.

Tyson is a financial consultant at a regional firm in Lexington. He grew up on a farm in western Kentucky and still goes back to visit his parents and ride the tractor every now and then.

Here is one of Dae Gak's poems:

__Put On Your Robe__

<blockquote>
Put on your robe, your gown, your dancing shoes, your vestments.<br>
Pray.<br>
    
Not to someone or something you have been taught about<br>
But to what you know and feel and live in each moment.<br>
     
Find what your heart already knows<br>
Not what your thinking believes about it.<br>
     
Find your tears, which flow without end<br>
Where there was once only blame and disappointment.<br>
     
Find your friends, your lovers,<br>
Your breath, your parents<br>
From ten thousand life times.<br>

Find your True Self and never let go.<br>
     
Hold the question without conclusion.<br>
    
And breathe, breathe into the belly of this beast<br>
whose heart is loss and whose intelligence is not knowing.<br>
     
In a little over one hundred years everyone who is on earth today will be gone.<br>
     
There is no enlightenment other than... This!
