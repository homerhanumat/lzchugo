## Welcome!

The Lexington Zen Center is a non-profit organization affiliated with the <a href="http://www.furnacemountainzen.org/" target="_blank"> Furnace Mountain Zen Retreat Center</a> in Clay City, Kentucky.  The Lexington Center provides a friendly and non-threatening environment for the pursuit of spiritual practice.

We are Buddhist by lineage but we welcome persons of all faiths and spiritual persuasions.  In addition to regular Wednesday and Sunday meditation services, we have special Beginner days, a lively Book Group that meets roughly every other week, and we hold several day-long retreats each year.

## Getting Here

We are located in a quiet, secluded residential area in Lexington.  Visitors and new folks should <a href="/contact">contact us</a> to get the address and to give us notice so we can figure out parking.  (Our parking lot holds only 10-12 cars. :smile:)

If you are new, try to arrive about 15 minutes early in order to get settled.
  
## Sundays

On Sundays the sitting begins at 4:30pm and concludes by about 5:40pm.  Follow the links under the Practice menu to learn more about the Sunday sits.

## Wednesdays
